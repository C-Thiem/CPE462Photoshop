# CPE462Photoshop

This project was done in a Visual Studios environment with OpenCV library. In order to start this project, one must follow this tutorial with the most up to date openCV package. (https://www.deciphertechnic.com/install-opencv-with-visual-studio/)
Once you are set up, you can decide the image you want to perform enhancement on by changing the path to the image in the main function. For the purposes of qualitative analysis, the group has to decided to work on one image to see the effectiveness of each function. However, changing the image path in the main function will allow you to use any image if you wish.

We will be using a median blur filter to simulate blur and a additive gaussian noise filter to similar noise in an image. In order to fix blur, we will be using a sharpen filter. To try to reduce gaussian noise, we will be using a median and average filter. We will also qualitatively analyze our results to see the effectiveness of our solutions.
